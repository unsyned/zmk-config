__**TYPING**__
**Same Finger Bigram (SFB)**: Pressing two keys with the same finger in conjunction.
**Same Finger Skipgram (SFS)**: Pressing two keys with the same finger, but separated by x letters.
**Disjointed Same Finger Bigram (dSFB)**: Synonym for SFS. Not used as much anymore.
**Lateral Stretch Bigram (LSB)**: A bigram where your hand must stretch laterally, as in using the middle finger following middle column usage on the same hand. An example is `be` on QWERTY.
**Alt-fingering**: Pressing a key with a different finger than would be typed with traditional touch typing technique.
**Alternation**: Pressing a key with the opposite hand than you typed the last.
**Roll**: Typing two or more keys with the same hand, moving in the same "direction". For example, on QWERTY, `sdf` would be a roll, but `sfd` would not.
**Inward/Outward Roll**: A roll which goes in a particular direction. Inward means towards the center of the keyboard, like `df` on QWERTY. Outward means away from the center, like `fd` on QWERTY. Many people, but not all, consider inward rolls to be more comfortable than outward rolls.
**Redirect/Redirection**: A one-handed sequence of at least three letters that 'changes directions'. For example, on QWERTY, `sfd` would be a redirect, but `sdf` would not.
**Hand Balance**: How much work each hand does for a layout. For example, a 35%:65% hand balance would mean that the left hand types 35% of keys, and the right hand types 65%.
**Scissor**: A vague concept that generally refers to fingers curling or extending in awkward relations to other fingers on the same hand. QWERTY `cw` and `ex` are usually considered significant examples of scissors.
